#  Tomato Plant Disease Classification

A deep learning project to classify tomato plant leaf images into **healthy** or **diseased categories**.  
This project was independently completed over 4 months using a Kaggle dataset and demonstrates skills in computer vision, deep learning, and model evaluation.

---

##  Project Overview
Tomato plants are highly susceptible to various diseases that can affect crop quality and yield. Early detection of these diseases is crucial for farmers to take preventive measures.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify tomato plant diseases from leaf images.
